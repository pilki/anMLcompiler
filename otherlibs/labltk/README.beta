This version is BETA release
============================
This source release is only beta and not well tested in various platforms.
I would be glad if you try to use mlTk to compile your CamlTk/LablTk 
applications and report problems at Jun.Furuse@inria.fr, if you have.

As an example, this distribution also contains a mlTk port of MMM
web browser. Read mmm/README.mltk for the installation.
