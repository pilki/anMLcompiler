- Started a bit of emacs mode.

- Added module 'Proc' in the standard library.

- Handle type constraints in join-patterns (slight change
  in typecore).

- Unused var warning corrected.

- In Join_space: rid_from_space catches Join_space.NoLink in all situations and
  raises Join.Exit. -> site_of_addr raise Join.Exit when
  remote site is dead.

- Be more eager to fork (tasks were entered uselessly in pool)
