2011-03-07: first uploaded version, branch somewhere before r10976
 * "ocamlc" and "ocamlopt" working, but yet not "ocamldep" and "ocaml".
 * Added options -namespace, -open-namespace, -debug
 * "-namespace -" tells the compiler to use the relative path as namespace
 * Use "-debug ns" to debug
 * Use "in X.Y" as the first line of your program to choose the namespace, instead
   of -namespace
 * Use "open X as Y" to alias modules and namespaces
