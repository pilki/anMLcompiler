(** Hash tables and hash functions.

   Hash tables are hashed association tables, with in-place modification.
*)


(** {6 Generic interface} *)


type ('a, 'b) t
(** The type of hash tables from type ['a] to type ['b]. *)

val create : ?seed:int -> int -> ('a, 'b) t
(** [Hashtbl.create n] creates a new, empty hash table, with
   initial size [n].  For best results, [n] should be on the
   order of the expected number of elements that will be in
   the table.  The table grows as needed, so [n] is just an
   initial guess.

   The optional [seed] parameter (an integer) can be given to
   diversify the hash function used to access the returned table.
   With high probability, hash tables created with different seeds
   have different collision patterns.  In Web-facing applications 
   for instance, it is recommended to create hash tables with a
   randomly-chosen seed.  This prevents a denial-of-service attack
   whereas a malicious user sends input crafted to create many
   collisions in the table and therefore slow the application down. *)

val clear : ('a, 'b) t -> unit
(** Empty a hash table. *)


val add : ('a, 'b) t -> 'a -> 'b -> unit
(** [Hashtbl.add tbl x y] adds a binding of [x] to [y] in table [tbl].
   Previous bindings for [x] are not removed, but simply
   hidden. That is, after performing {!Hashtbl.remove}[ tbl x],
   the previous binding for [x], if any, is restored.
   (Same behavior as with association lists.) *)

val copy : ('a, 'b) t -> ('a, 'b) t
(** Return a copy of the given hashtable. *)

val find : ('a, 'b) t -> 'a -> 'b
(** [Hashtbl.find tbl x] returns the current binding of [x] in [tbl],
   or raises [Not_found] if no such binding exists. *)

val find_all : ('a, 'b) t -> 'a -> 'b list
(** [Hashtbl.find_all tbl x] returns the list of all data
   associated with [x] in [tbl].
   The current binding is returned first, then the previous
   bindings, in reverse order of introduction in the table. *)

val mem : ('a, 'b) t -> 'a -> bool
(** [Hashtbl.mem tbl x] checks if [x] is bound in [tbl]. *)

val remove : ('a, 'b) t -> 'a -> unit
(** [Hashtbl.remove tbl x] removes the current binding of [x] in [tbl],
   restoring the previous binding if it exists.
   It does nothing if [x] is not bound in [tbl]. *)

val replace : ('a, 'b) t -> 'a -> 'b -> unit
(** [Hashtbl.replace tbl x y] replaces the current binding of [x]
   in [tbl] by a binding of [x] to [y].  If [x] is unbound in [tbl],
   a binding of [x] to [y] is added to [tbl].
   This is functionally equivalent to {!Hashtbl.remove}[ tbl x]
   followed by {!Hashtbl.add}[ tbl x y]. *)

val iter : ('a -> 'b -> unit) -> ('a, 'b) t -> unit
(** [Hashtbl.iter f tbl] applies [f] to all bindings in table [tbl].
   [f] receives the key as first argument, and the associated value
   as second argument. Each binding is presented exactly once to [f].
   The order in which the bindings are passed to [f] is unspecified.
   However, if the table contains several bindings for the same key,
   they are passed to [f] in reverse order of introduction, that is,
   the most recent binding is passed first. *)

val fold : ('a -> 'b -> 'c -> 'c) -> ('a, 'b) t -> 'c -> 'c
(** [Hashtbl.fold f tbl init] computes
   [(f kN dN ... (f k1 d1 init)...)],
   where [k1 ... kN] are the keys of all bindings in [tbl],
   and [d1 ... dN] are the associated values.
   Each binding is presented exactly once to [f].
   The order in which the bindings are passed to [f] is unspecified.
   However, if the table contains several bindings for the same key,
   they are passed to [f] in reverse order of introduction, that is,
   the most recent binding is passed first. *)


val length : ('a, 'b) t -> int
(** [Hashtbl.length tbl] returns the number of bindings in [tbl].
   It takes constant time.  Multiple bindings are counted once each, so
   [Hashtbl.length] gives the number of times [Hashtbl.iter] calls its
   first argument. *)

type statistics = {
  num_bindings: int;
    (** Number of bindings present in the table.
        Same value as returned by {!Hashtbl.length}. *)
  num_buckets: int;
    (** Number of buckets in the table. *)
  max_bucket_length: int;
    (** Maximal number of bindings per bucket. *)
  bucket_histogram: int array
    (** Histogram of bucket sizes.  This array [histo] has
        length [hash_max_bucket_length + 1].  The value of
        [histo.(i)] is the number of buckets whose size is [i]. *)
}

val stats : ('a, 'b) t -> statistics
(** [Hashtbl.stats tbl] returns statistics about the table [tbl]:
   number of buckets, size of the biggest bucket, distribution of
   buckets by size. *)

module type HashedType =

    type t
      (** The type of the hashtable keys. *)
    val equal : t -> t -> bool
      (** The equality predicate used to compare keys. *)
    val hash : t -> int
      (** A hashing function on keys. It must be such that if two keys are
          equal according to [equal], then they have identical hash values
          as computed by [hash].
          Examples: suitable ([equal], [hash]) pairs for arbitrary key
          types include
-         ([(=)], {!Hashtbl.hash}) for comparing objects by structure

              and handling {!Pervasives.nan} correctly
-         ([(==)], {!Hashtbl.hash}) for comparing objects by physical
              equality (e.g. for mutable or cyclic objects). *)

    a type [key] of keys and a type ['a t] of hash tables
    associating data of type ['a] to keys of type [key].

    equality and hashing.  The optional [seed] argument to the

    The functor [Hashtbl.MakeSeeded] returns a structure containing
    a type [key] of keys and a type ['a t] of hash tables
    associating data of type ['a] to keys of type [key].
    The operations perform similarly to those of the generic

(** {6 The polymorphic hash functions} *)


val hash : 'a -> int
(** [Hashtbl.hash x] associates a nonnegative integer to any value of
   any type. It is guaranteed that
   if [x = y] or [Pervasives.compare x y = 0], then [hash x = hash y].
   Moreover, [hash] always terminates, even on cyclic structures. *)

val seeded_hash : int -> 'a -> int
(** A variant of {!Hashtbl.hash} that is further parameterized by
   an integer seed.
   @since 3.13.0 *)

val hash_param : int -> int -> 'a -> int
(** [Hashtbl.hash_param meaningful total x] computes a hash value for [x],
   with the same properties as for [hash]. The two extra integer
   parameters [meaningful] and [total] give more precise control over
   hashing. Hashing performs a breadth-first, left-to-right traversal
   of the structure [x], stopping after [meaningful] meaningful nodes
   were encountered, or [total] nodes (meaningful or not) were
   encountered. Meaningful nodes are: integers; floating-point
   numbers; strings; characters; booleans; and constant
   constructors. Larger values of [meaningful] and [total] means that
   more nodes are taken into account to compute the final hash value,
   and therefore collisions are less likely to happen.  However,
   hashing takes longer. The parameters [meaningful] and [total]
   govern the tradeoff between accuracy and speed.  As default
   choices, {!Hashtbl.hash} and {!Hashtbl.seeded_hash} take
   [meaningful = 10] and [total = 100]. *)

val seeded_hash_param : int -> int -> int -> 'a -> int
(** A variant of {!Hashtbl.hash_param} that is further parameterized by
   an integer seed.  Usage: 
   [Hashtbl.seeded_hash_param meaningful total seed x].
