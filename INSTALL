            Installing JoCaml on a Unix machine
            -----------------------------------

CONTEXT
  The JoCaml system is a modification of the Objective Caml system.
  As such, JoCaml installation is derived from Objective Caml installation.

  This distribution includes the 'INSTALL' file of Objective Caml under
  the name 'INSTALL_OCAML'. Here we focus on differences with Objective
  Caml installation.


* They are the same as the ones of Objective Caml,

* plus: the POSIX threads library 'phreads' is required.


INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

1- Configure the system. From the top directory, do:

        ./configure

With respect to Objective Caml the "configure" script options are modified
as follows.

Suppressed options.

* All option relative to labltk are suppressed, since labltk is not supported.

* The -with-pthread and -no-pthread options are suppressed, JoCaml cannot
  be build without the native POSIX thread library.

Added options.

   JoCaml may have a 'companion' Objective Caml, so as to allow
   object level compatibility beetween JoCaml and OCaml. There are
   severe restructions: the version numbers of both systems should match.

-ocamlc <ocamlc bytecode compiler>
   If <ocamlc bytecode compiler> is executable, then the script runs it,
   to check version number and, when it matches with JoCaml version number,
   to extract the location of the Objective Caml library.
     By default, this option is activated with value 'ocamlc'

-ocamllib <dir>
   The Objective Caml library is <dir>. No version check is performed. Use
   this option at your own risk.

<<<<<<< .courant
=======
-no-curses
        Do not use the curses library.

-host <hosttype>                (default: determined automatically)
        The type of the host machine, in GNU's "configuration name"
        format (CPU-COMPANY-SYSTEM). This info is generally determined
        automatically by the "configure" script, and rarely ever
        needs to be provided by hand. The installation instructions
        for gcc or emacs contain a complete list of configuration names.

-x11include <include_dir>       (default: determined automatically)
-x11lib     <lib_dir>           (default: determined automatically)
        Location of the X11 include directory (e.g. /usr/X11R6/include)
        and the X11 library directory (e.g. /usr/X11R6/lib).

-tkdefs <cpp flags>             (default: none)
-tklibs <flags and libraries>   (default: determined automatically)
        These options specify where to find the Tcl/Tk libraries for
        LablTk. "-tkdefs" helps to find the headers, and "-tklibs"
        the C libraries. "-tklibs" may contain either only -L/path and
        -Wl,... flags, in which case the library names are determined
        automatically, or the actual libraries, which are used as given.
        Example: for a Japanese tcl/tk whose headers are in specific
        directories and libraries in /usr/local/lib, you can use
        ./configure -tklibs "-L/usr/local/lib -ltk8.0jp -ltcl8.0jp"
          -tkdefs "-I/usr/local/include/tcl8.0jp -I/usr/local/include/tk8.0jp"

-tk-no-x11
        Build LablTk without using X11. This option is needed on Cygwin.

-no-tk
        Do not attempt to build LablTk.

-no-pthread
        Do not attempt to use POSIX threads.

-with-pthread
        Attempt to use POSIX threads (this is the default).

-no-shared-libs
        Do not configure support for shared libraries

-dldefs <cpp flags>
-dllibs <flags and libraries>
        These options specify where to find the libraries for dynamic
        linking (i.e. use of shared libraries).  "-dldefs" specifies
        options for finding the header files, and "-dllibs" for finding
        the C libraries.

-as <assembler and options>     (default: determined automatically)
        The assembler to use for assembling ocamlopt-generated code.

-aspp <assembler and options>   (default: determined automatically)
        The assembler to use for assembling the parts of the
        run-time system manually written in assembly language.
        This assembler must preprocess its input with the C preprocessor.

-verbose
        Verbose output of the configuration tests. Use it if the outcome
        of configure is not what you were expecting.

Examples:

  Standard installation in /usr/{bin,lib,man} instead of /usr/local:
    ./configure -prefix /usr

  Installation in /usr, man pages in section "l":
    ./configure -bindir /usr/bin -libdir /usr/lib/ocaml -mandir /usr/man/manl

  On a MacOSX 10.5/Intel Core 2 or MacOSX 10.5/PowerPC host,
  to build a 64-bit version of OCaml:
    ./configure -cc "gcc -m64"

  On a MacOSX 10.6/Intel Core 2, to build a 32-bit version of OCaml:
    ./configure -cc "gcc -m32" -as "as -arch i386" -aspp "gcc -m32 -c"

  On a Linux x86/64 bits host, to build a 32-bit version of OCaml:
    ./configure -cc "gcc -m32" -as "as --32" -aspp "gcc -m32 -c"

  On a Linux x86/64 bits host, to build the run-time system in PIC mode
  (enables putting the runtime in a shared library, 
   at a small performance cost):
    ./configure -cc "gcc -fPIC" -aspp "gcc -c -fPIC"

  For Sun Solaris with the "acc" compiler:
    ./configure -cc "acc -fast" -libs "-lucb"

  For AIX 4.3 with the IBM compiler xlc:
    ./configure -cc "xlc_r -D_AIX43 -Wl,-bexpall,-brtl -qmaxmem=8192"


If something goes wrong during the automatic configuration, or if the
generated files cause errors later on, then look at the template files

        config/Makefile-templ
        config/m-templ.h
        config/s-templ.h

for guidance on how to edit the generated files by hand.

2- From the top directory, do:

        make world


4- If your platform is supported by the native-code compiler (as
reported during the autoconfiguration), you can now build the
native-code compiler. From the top directory, do:

        make opt

5- Compile fast versions of the Objective Caml compilers, by
compiling them with the native-code compiler (you have only compiled
them to bytecode so far).  Just do:

        make opt.opt

6- You can now install the JoCaml system. This will create the
JoCaml commands (in the binary directory selected during
autoconfiguration).

<<<<<<< .courant
=======
An alternative, and faster approach to steps 2 to 5 is

        make world.opt          # to build using native-code compilers

The result is equivalent to "make world opt opt.opt", but this may
fail if anything goes wrong in native-code generation.

Another alternative, is to use the experimental build system that use
ocamlbuild instead of make (it replaces steps 2 to 5):

        ./build/fastworld.sh

If it doesn't work, just use one of the make-based procedures described
above.

6- You can now install the Objective Caml system. This will create the
following commands (in the binary directory selected during
autoconfiguration):

        ocamlc           the batch bytecode compiler
        ocamlopt         the batch native-code compiler (if supported)
        ocamlrun         the runtime system for the bytecode compiler
        ocamlyacc        the parser generator
        ocamllex         the lexer generator
        ocaml            the interactive, toplevel-based system
        ocamlmktop       a tool to make toplevel systems that integrate
                         user-defined C primitives and Caml code
        ocamldebug       the source-level replay debugger
        ocamldep         generator of "make" dependencies for Caml sources
        ocamldoc         documentation generator
        ocamlprof        execution count profiler
        ocamlcp          the bytecode compiler in profiling mode

and also, if you built them during step 5,

        ocamlc.opt       the batch bytecode compiler compiled with ocamlopt
        ocamlopt.opt     the batch native-code compiler compiled with ocamlopt
        ocamllex.opt     the lexer generator compiled with ocamlopt

>>>>>>> .fusion-droit.r10632
From the top directory, become superuser and do:

        umask 022       # make sure to give read & execute permission to all
        make install


The JoCaml commands are Ocaml commands prefixed by 'j'.
That is jocamlc, jocamlopt, jocamlrun, jocamlyacc, jocamllex, jocaml,
jocamlmktop, jocamlmklib, jocamldep.


Some of OCaml commands have no JoCaml equivalent: ocamldebug,
ocamlprof, ocamlcp, ocamldoc.
